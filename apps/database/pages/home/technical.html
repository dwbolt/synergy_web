<h3>Some Technical Information</h3>

<p>You do not have to understand the following infromation to use the database.  This information maybe of interest to more technical people.</p>

<p>The current implementations is an in memory client side database. This works well for small databases on the order of mega btye.  I've used the database locally on much larger database sets.  The longer term plan is to also support server side datbases as well.  Each user has their data stored in a seperate collection of folders.  When you login and click on database no one else has access to your data.</p>

<p>We use relational database language to talk about the building blocks, but it also has elements of graph and object databases.  Each server manages a collection of databases.</p>

<ul>
<li>server  - each user has their own server</li>
<li>databases - each user will have a synergy database where application data is stored. The may also create other databases</li>
<li>tables - are simialr to spreedsheet with rows and columns</li> 
<li>rows  - are displayed accross the page</li>
<li>fields - are the columns of the page</li>   
</ul>
