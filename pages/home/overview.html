<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
The Synergy Project came out of the desire for Sustainable Future Center to create synergy among it's donors,
 supporters, volunteers, and partner organizations.  The intent is to make the synergy software available to 
 other non-profits as it matures.</p>
 
 <p>Sustainable Future Center is currently using the software for it's website.  
 Work has stared on accounting, database and CRM.  We curretly have a few other non-profits using 
the syergy calender on their website.  Beta test orgization's are working with us to define their needs for accounting, databases and CRM.
